      <h2>Asino Puzzles</h2>
      <p>Asino Puzzles is a puzzle framework created by Tova Dev. The original assignment was to make a game similar to Sim City, but more puzzle-y. The result was a minor flop, but the attempt to make this game had the byproduct of this flexible puzzle framework that can be used for the creation of a wide variety of other bespoke puzzles.</p>
      <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>Also on this website are a couple of other minor distractions. TODO</p>
      <h2>Tova Dev</h2>
      <p>Tova Dev lives in Aotearoa New Zealand. They grew up with an Amiga 1000 and had ambitions to grow up to make Amiga games for a living. Sadly the Amiga system did not survive the 1990's and it is impossible to earn a living making games for a dead computer. Now they make proper adult software for a living and web games in their spare time. They are also trying to write a novel about making computer games for the Amiga computer.</p>
      <p>Their IRL name is David Thomsen.</p>
