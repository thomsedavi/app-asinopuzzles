        <Paragraph>Asino Puzzles is a puzzle framework created by Lotographia. The original assignment was to make a game similar to Sim City, but more puzzle-y. The result was a minor flop, but the attempt to make this game had the byproduct of this flexible puzzle framework that can be used for the creation of a wide variety of other bespoke puzzles.</Paragraph>

        <Heading2>Lotographia</Heading2>
        <Paragraph>Lotographia lives in Aotearoa New Zealand. They grew up with an Amiga 1000 and had ambitions to grow up to make Amiga games for a living. Sadly the Amiga system did not survive the 1990's and it is impossible to earn a living making games for a dead computer. Now they make proper adult software for a living and web games in their spare time. They are also trying to write a novel about making computer games for the Amiga computer.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Their IRL name is David Thomsen.</Paragraph>
